# Air Line Safety Prediciton

One of the key components of an airline system is safety. In this data ,we might classify and cluster the dataset using the right data mining tools. Based on the number of events, fatal accidents, and fatalities between the years 1985 and 1999 and 2000 and 2014, we have precise statistics. In order to answer the question "which is the best airline in the world?," we will use the dataset. We tested four data mining approaches (Naive Baiyes, C4.5, K-NN, K-fold Validation) here to examine which yields the greatest outcomes. From those, K-fold validation offered a greater accuracy of 0.8 for them.
